The University Athletes Information Management System is a cutting-edge software solution tailored to the specific needs of universities in Central Luzon, Philippines. It was conceived to address the common challenges faced by educational institutions when it comes to managing their athletes, sports teams, and participation in sports events. This system aims to revolutionize the way universities handle sports-related activities, making it easier, more efficient, and secure.

#### Project Goals and Objectives:

 - Efficient Athlete Management: The primary objective of this project is to revolutionize the way universities in Central Luzon manage their athletes. It replaces the cumbersome manual methods of maintaining athlete profiles with a streamlined, digital approach. This ensures that athlete information is easily accessible and up-to-date.

 - Streamlined Event Participation: One of the key features of this system is its ability to simplify the process of registering and participating in sports events. Universities can seamlessly join events in Central Luzon without the administrative hassle that previously accompanied such endeavors.

 - User-Centric Design: The system is designed to cater to four distinct user roles, each with specific responsibilities and permissions. These roles include the Admin, University Sports Director, Coaches, and Athletes. This user-centric approach ensures that every stakeholder in the sports management process has the tools and resources they need at their fingertips.

#### Key Features:

 - Admin: The Admin role is the backbone of the system. Admins can manage universities, University Sports Directors, events, and sports categories. They have complete oversight of the system and can view records for all universities and events. Additionally, they have the capability to generate detailed reports, making data-driven decisions a breeze.

 - University Sports Director: University Sports Directors are tasked with managing their respective universities' sports programs. They oversee coaches, athletes, and sports teams within their institution. They play a pivotal role in coordinating their university's participation in events, monitoring records, and ensuring compliance with sports regulations.

- Coaches: Coaches are vital to the system as they are responsible for managing their sports teams. They can accept athlete applications, monitor team performance, and generate reports, including team galleries. Furthermore, coaches can efficiently oversee the requirements submitted by their athletes, ensuring eligibility for participation in events.

 - Athletes: Athletes benefit from the system as well. They can apply for specific sports, view team information, manage their profiles, and submit any necessary documentation and requirements. This empowers athletes to have more agency in their sports journey, making their interaction with the system user-friendly and efficient.

#### Security Features:

 - User Hierarchy: To guarantee the security and integrity of the data, the system maintains a well-defined user hierarchy. This hierarchy controls the levels of access and permissions, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible by authorized personnel. The hierarchical structure also enables an organized and efficient management of sports-related activities.

 - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): The inclusion of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to the system. This feature enhances the safeguarding of user accounts by requiring additional verification steps during the login process. It effectively protects user credentials from unauthorized access, further bolstering the security of the system.

In conclusion, the University Athletes Information Management System is a comprehensive and user-focused software solution that transforms how universities in Central Luzon manage their athletes, sports teams, and participation in sports events. It streamlines processes, enhances security, and empowers universities, coaches, and athletes alike, creating a more efficient and organized sports management ecosystem.
